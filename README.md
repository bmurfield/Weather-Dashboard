## Description
A deployed webpage that uses weather apis to show accurate forecast data for multiple cities.

* Wanted to make an iteractive website that shows current and future weather in cities arouns the world.

* Creates a webpage where the user types in a city and it outputs the current weather and 5 day forecast.

* It also stores previously searced cities if you would like review them.

* In this project I learned how to implement a weather API. This was my first project working with an API Key and .env file.
